# ai-life-hacks

This repo is a lightweight, high-signal toolkit for thriving in the AI age. It includes minimalist systems designed to reduce cognitive drag, preserve flow, and adapt to idea overload.

## Included Systems

- 'no-bs.md' - Counter-Manipulative High-Density Communication Protocol for no or low bs AI responses.

- `idea-organizer.md` — A dynamic Markdown-based system for processing floods of ideas without losing essence. Uses category theory, psychology, and smart labeling to turn scattered thoughts into a structured, collapsible document. Optimized for iterative input and revision, with two modes: ORGANIZE (`@OO`) and DISCUSSION (`@DD`).

- `add-bujo.md` — A clean, OCD/ADD-friendly bullet journal system using an asymmetric notebook layout. Collections go in the front, daily logs in the back. No pre-allocation. No rigidity. Reduces decision fatigue and friction. Captures both timeless thinking and tactical execution in one place.

## Philosophy

• Minimal overhead, maximal flow  
• Frictionless structure beats feature-rich bloat  
• Designed for humans navigating high-input, high-distraction environments

Use these tools to think clearly, act fast, and stay sane amid the noise.
