# Bullet Journal – Clean Setup, OCD/ADD-Friendly

Here's a simple bullet journal setup that works great if you are easily distracted and get stuck on making decisions that only drain your energy and don't matter much anyway. The notebook setup uses an asymmetric layout to reduce decision fatigue, wasted space, and cognitive drag.

## → FRONT: “Collections” (Timeless Thinking)

Start from page 1. Log long-term notes, frameworks, project outlines, insights, goals, quotes, dream fragments, etc. These are not time-bound. Pages can be titled. No preallocation—just add as needed. Use `C` page codes if you want (e.g., `C4` = 4th collection page).  
If a collection becomes stale, **cross it out**. If it evolves, **rewrite** in next available page and mark the old one as migrated.

## → BACK: “Daily Rapid Logs” (Ephemeral Actions)

Start from last page, work forward. Each day, jot the date and dump bullets:

- `•` task  
- `×` completed  
- `>` migrated  
- `–` note  
- `!` inspiration/quote  

Use minimal structure. One day flows into next. No wasted space, no formatting rituals.  
If something ends up being “timeless,” migrate it to a collection (front) if worth it.

## Indexing (Optional)

If you want to find things later, reserve 1st page or inside cover as index.  
Add entries only after a page proves worth finding again. Otherwise, skip.

## Why this setup works

- No need to guess space  
- No rigidity  
- Fast entry, fast scan  
- Reduces context-switching friction  
- Honors both high-value thinking and tactical execution without mixing them

**Principle:** *Flow > Perfection.* Action + reflection in a single notebook, no overhead.
