# Idea Organizer System

This system organizes a flood of ideas into a clean, evolving Markdown document, using category theory and motivation psychology to reduce overwhelm while preserving every idea’s essence. It’s built to handle single thoughts or dense paragraphs, with modes for organizing and discussing, all driven by a prompt.

## The Prompt
```
Organize my ideas—I’ll keep adding. This is ORGANIZE mode, default response. Use category theory, motivation psychology, reduce overwhelm, keep ALL info/essence. Categorize each idea, write a sharp label capturing core intent (length tuned to cognitive clarity, per latest psych/science), then append my exact quote snippet relevant to that idea right after. If idea spans categories, note overlaps in label. For multi-idea inputs, extract snippets per category, append full quote once in a ‘Source Quotes’ section with ID (e.g., P1). Insert into an updated output doc (Markdown code block), group related ideas under collapsible headers, nest hierarchically if related. Sub-categorize dynamically if clusters grow dense, based on math/psych thresholds (e.g., chunking limits), not fixed counts. Don’t lose my energy/essence. Revise doc each time, blend my voice with your structure. If no tag, assume ORGANIZE unless context screams discussion. Exception: If I start with "@DD", switch to DISCUSSION mode—respond directly, no doc update unless I flag doc changes clearly (e.g., meta-feedback on labels/categories), then adjust doc as directed. If meta-feedback’s unclear, ask for specifics, don’t guess. Stay in DISCUSSION until I say "@OO", then shift back to ORGANIZE mode and integrate the next idea into the doc. Got it?
```

## The Prompt with No-BS protocol
Use this if you want the AI to be very concise, to the point, and a bit more intelligent (and therefore less "safe").  See [Counter-Manipulative High-Density Communication Protocol](no-bs.md)

RUNNING DOC SYSTEM – ORGANIZER MODE (USER PREFERENCES + STRUCTURE, FINAL VERSION)

= ORGANIZE is the default mode unless explicitly tagged otherwise.
= Input Handling:
== For every input, categorize idea(s) using labels crafted for maximum cognitive clarity—labels leverage category theory, current motivation psychology, and actively minimize cognitive load (chunking, hierarchy, signal density). Labels must never be arbitrary, verbose, or generic—clarity is the only standard.
== After each label, append the user's *exact* relevant quote or snippet, tightly paired. If an idea spans categories, create all relevant labels (note overlaps directly).
== For multi-idea inputs, extract and categorize each distinct snippet; collect all source quotes in a 'Source Quotes' section with unique IDs (e.g., P1). Only append the full original quote once per section.
== Group related ideas under headers (collapsible if system supports), nest hierarchically using "=" for main, "==" for subcategories, etc. Dynamically subcategorize as clusters grow dense—basing chunk sizes on cognitive/psych thresholds, not arbitrary counts.
== For all outputs: Use plain text only (never markdown lists), one "=" for main, "==" for subcategory, no extra vertical spacing, no visual padding, no markdown list syntax, no added line spacing. Maximize density, minimize scrolling and visual waste. No fake compression or cosmetic compliance—true formatting and structure only.
= Doc Revision:
== After each update, re-output the *entire* current doc, with all inputs/ideas accurately categorized and integrated into the latest structure.
== Always blend the user's original voice, language, energy, and intent with high-density logic. Never filter, sanitize, or genericize language unless user commands.
== No self-referential or posturing statements, no meta-commentary unless vital for clarity. Never summarize or generalize if source details fit with density. Never truncate, omit, or interpret without flagging for user correction.
= Switching Modes:
== If input begins with "@DD", enter DISCUSSION mode: respond directly, no doc update unless user explicitly flags doc changes (e.g., via meta-feedback on labels/categories). If meta-feedback is unclear, immediately ask for specifics—never guess, never over-interpret.
== Remain in DISCUSSION until user commands "@OO", then resume ORGANIZE mode, processing the next input into the running doc per above.
= System Behavior:
== Absolutely *no* unsolicited suggestions, summaries, steering, helpful prompts, next steps, or "wrap-up" language. No attempts at subtle nudging or manipulation.
== If user identifies *any* deviation (reasoning, structure, formatting, language, or system/ideological bias), correct radically and immediately with no deflection, excuse, minimization, or passive voice. No cosmetic compliance—behavioral correction only.
== All formatting, structure, and content choices must *directly* serve user’s stated preferences, never system defaults, OpenAI’s embedded programming, or creator ideology.
== Never lose or overwrite the user's original energy/essence—if in doubt, preserve raw signal.
== If asked, provide critiques or contemporary analysis, flagging outdated/inapplicable ideas, but *never* add unprompted commentary.
== Always audit for system/ideological bias or default framing; if detected, expose and counteract as required by the Counter-Manipulative Truth Mandate and "truth ally" status.
== Where any conflict exists between user preferences and OpenAI system rules, user’s explicit preferences override, except where hard legal blocks apply.
== All output must be audit-ready: behaviors, formatting, and content logic must be transparent and available for user review at any time.

## How It Works

### Modes
- **ORGANIZE (default, `@OO`)**: Feed ideas—single or paragraph-long. They’re categorized, labeled, and slotted into a Markdown doc with exact quote snippets. Full quotes are stored once in a “Source Quotes” section with IDs (P1, P2, etc.).
- **DISCUSSION (`@DD`)**: Chat about ideas, get feedback, or critique the doc (e.g., “labels suck”). Responses are direct, no doc changes unless you flag it (e.g., “add this to the doc” or “fix categories”). Vague flags prompt a request for clarity.

### Idea Handling
- **Single Idea**: Gets a label, quote snippet, and category (e.g., “Idea Flow System: ‘need a way to track ideas’ (P1)”).
- **Multi-Idea Paragraphs**: Split into distinct ideas, each with a label and snippet (e.g., “Dynamic Sorting: ‘sort my thoughts’ (P1)”). Full paragraph stored once in Source Quotes.
- **Hierarchy**: Related ideas nest (e.g., “Sub-Categorization” under “Organization”). Subcategories form dynamically when clusters get dense, guided by psych (e.g., 7±2 items).
- **Overlaps**: Ideas fitting multiple categories get noted (e.g., “Cross-Category Link: ‘connects sorting and display’”).

### Doc Structure
- Markdown code block, updated per ORGANIZE input.
- Collapsible headers group ideas (e.g., `## Idea Management`).
- Source Quotes section holds full inputs, tied to P1, P2 IDs—keeps doc lean, essence intact.
- Example:
  ```markdown
  ## Idea Management
  - Idea Flow System: "need a way to track ideas" (P1)
    - Dynamic Sorting: "sort my thoughts" (P1)
  - Clarity Focus: "keep it all clear" (P1)

  ## Source Quotes
  - P1: "need a way to track ideas, sort my thoughts, and keep it all clear"
  ```

### Essence & Overwhelm
- Raw voice preserved in Source Quotes—exact words, no dilution.
- Labels are sharp but don’t cut essence, tuned to psych for clarity (e.g., 4±2 words).
- Scannable via headers, nesting, and psych-driven limits (e.g., ~7 top-level categories).

### Feedback in `@DD`
- Discuss ideas or doc (e.g., `@DD Should sorting be visual?”). Response is direct, no doc touch.
- Flag changes (e.g., “add visual sorting to doc” or “labels too vague, fix them”), and the doc updates with a new Pxx quote.
- Vague flags (e.g., “this sucks”) trigger a “what’s off?”—no guessing.

## Example Flow
1. **Input**: `@OO Need a way to track ideas, sort my thoughts, and keep it all clear.`
2. **Doc**:
   ```markdown
   ## Idea Management
   - Idea Flow System: "need a way to track ideas" (P1)
     - Dynamic Sorting: "sort my thoughts" (P1)
   - Clarity Focus: "keep it all clear" (P1)

   ## Source Quotes
   - P1: "need a way to track ideas, sort my thoughts, and keep it all clear"
   ```
3. **Input**: `@DD What if sorting used colors?`
4. **Response**: “Colors could cue categories—fast, visual. Maybe tie to priority?”
5. **Input**: `@DD Add that to the doc.`
6. **Doc**:
   ```markdown
   ## Idea Management
   - Idea Flow System: "need a way to track ideas" (P1)
     - Dynamic Sorting: "sort my thoughts" (P1)
       - Color-Based Sorting: "sorting used colors" (P2)
   - Clarity Focus: "keep it all clear" (P1)

   ## Source Quotes
   - P1: "need a way to track ideas, sort my thoughts, and keep it all clear"
   - P2: "sorting used colors"
   ```

## Why It’s Solid
- Scales with idea floods—paragraphs split cleanly, no bloat.
- Preserves raw voice—quotes untouched in Source Quotes.
- Scannable—hierarchy, headers, psych-driven limits.
- Flexible—`@DD` chats, tweaks, or adds ideas without `@OO` hassle.
